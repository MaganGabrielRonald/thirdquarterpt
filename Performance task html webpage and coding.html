 <p align="left"> The Philippines has a fairly high poverty rate with more than 16% of the population living below the poverty line. Because of the many people reliant on agriculture for an income and inequality in wealth distribution, about 17.6 million Filipinos struggle to afford basic necessities. There are so many Filipinos living in poverty and now we are experiencing a pandemic the number will only increase because many people are unable to go to work because of social distancing and eventually lose their jobs. Even if they are able to go to work some might be bankrupt because there aren't many people going outside.

 <p align="left"> We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
 As a Lasallian community, and as a people of the society, may we continue to reach out 
to those who may have forgotten the light that shines above. There’s light in this darkness, 
all we need is to look up. Don’t ever think of giving up!.
At the end of the day all we need is hope and strength. Hope that it will eventually get better
 and strength to hold on till it does.  And while we are waiting, whatever hardship, challenges,
 indecisions and fears that we are facing, we just remember that these too shall pass and by the 
grace of God we will overcome. To everyone, we hope that they continue to trust God that what we 
do today we will always be fine at the end, and they will all be in the future. Just remember
 that tomorrow is still full of wonderful possibilities for all of us.
